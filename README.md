# company-behvior-analysis
1. Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, covering data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL operations, dashboard development, and automated reporting. The goal is to extract insights from a dataset using Python, SQL, and Power BI, and present the findings through a structured report and a PPT created using Gamma.

2. Dataset

The dataset is loaded in Python (Pandas).

Contains features related to customer behaviour/sales/transactions (dataset can be replaced as needed).

Raw data is cleaned, transformed, and prepared for analysis.

Dataset file is stored in the data/ folder.

4. Project Steps

 Step 1: Load Dataset

Read CSV file using Pandas

Inspect structure, data types, and missing values


 Step 2: Data Cleaning

Handle missing values

Remove/handle duplicates

Convert data types

Feature formatting and transformation


 Step 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate and bivariate analysis

Distribution plots, correlation analysis

Key insights extracted for reporting


 Step 4: SQL Analysis

Import cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL/MySQL/SQL Server

Run queries like:

Filtering

Group By & Aggregations

Window functions

Joins


Validate Python insights using SQL


 Step 5: Power BI Dashboard

Import cleaned dataset

Create visuals (bar, line, matrix, cards, KPIs)

Build an interactive dashboard


5. Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard highlights:

Key metrics & KPIs

Trends and patterns

Customer segmentation

High-impact insights for decision-making

Extract insights and results
